# End-to-End Anime Recommender System

Welcome to our anime recommender project! Our aim is to provide personalized recommendations for anime enthusiasts. In this project, we've developed three distinct recommender systems to cater to different user preferences and needs.

Firstly, we've implemented two content-based filtering recommenders utilizing Count Vectorization. These recommenders analyze textual descriptions and attributes of anime to suggest similar series based on their features. By understanding the characteristics and traits of each anime, these recommenders offer tailored suggestions that align with users' interests.

Additionally, we've incorporated a collaborative filtering approach using an embedding layer. This method considers user preferences and interactions with various anime to make personalized recommendations. By leveraging deep learning techniques, our collaborative filtering recommender identifies patterns in user behavior and predicts ratings for unseen anime, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations.

With these three recommenders in place, anime fans can discover new and exciting series, whether they're seeking action-packed adventures, heartwarming dramas, or fantastical escapades. Our end-to-end recommender system aims to inspire and assist anime fans in finding their next favorite series. Start your exploration today with our personalized anime recommendations!
